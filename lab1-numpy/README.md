# Week 1 - NumPy and functions

This course assumes you already have decent programming skills and are familiar with Python.

In the first lab, you're asked to use some functions from Numpy in order to get familiar with this library.
The official documentation for Numpy can be found here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/

There are no starting materials for this week. You can go to Moodle directly to do the programming on CodeRunner. 
Your answers will be automatically marked.
