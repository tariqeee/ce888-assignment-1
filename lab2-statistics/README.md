# Week 2 - Summary and resampling statistics

One of the core concepts we learnt in the lecture this week was that of resampling statistics, and we placed emphasis on the bootstrap as a very useful tool (that we will use in some of the next lectures as well).

In this lab, you will use Numpy to create your own bootstrap and permutation test functions in Python.
For this, you have some starting code and instructions on the notebook _statistics.ipynb_.

Once you have the two functions working, go to Moodle to start the quiz for this week.
As last week, your answers will be automatically marked.

Other files for this week:

- _customers.csv_: dataset of sales used to test your bootstrap function.
- _vehicles.csv_: dataset of vehicle consumption (in mpg -- miles per gallon) for two different fleets -- you'll need this for the quiz.
- _voting\_data.py_: dataset of percentages of democratic votes in Pennsylvania and Ohio -- you'll need this for the quiz.
